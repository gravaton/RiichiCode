RiichiCode
==========

Most of what's in here are my own code snippets around various Riichi mahjong things I've been doing.
Quick descriptions as follows:

Parsing/ - Tools for parsing and checking hand status
  HandGenerator.rb - Will build a wall and generate several hands
  HandParser.rb - Will parse a hand to determine ready status
  Scoring.rb - Totally incomplete and useless
Statistics/ - Tools for performing statistics on hand data
  generator.c - Generates every possible 14-tile hand (takes....a long time)
